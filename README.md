## Features

### 📊 Implementing State Management
I've mastered the art of managing app state efficiently using the Provider package. This ensures a smooth flow of data and UI updates, providing users with a seamless experience.

### 🌙 Dark Mode & Light Mode
To add a touch of elegance to the app, I've implemented both Dark Mode and Light Mode using Provider. Now users can enjoy a personalized visual experience that suits their preferences.

### 🔐 Authentication
Security is a top priority, and I've seamlessly integrated authentication into the app. Users can trust that their experience is not only beautiful but also secure.

### 🎨 Beautiful UI
With Provider at the helm, I've crafted a stunning user interface. The design not only looks great but also functions seamlessly, enhancing the overall user experience.
